# Python Assignments - PLP

## Week 1: User Input Program

### Instructions:
1. Create a new Python file and name it `user_input.py`.
2. Use the `input()` function to ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called `name`.
3. Use the `input()` function to ask the user for their age and store it in a variable called `age`.
4. Use the `input()` function to ask the user for their location and store it in a variable called `location`.
5. Print out a personalized message using the user's name, age, and location. 
   - Example: `Hello [name], you are [age] years old and live in [location].`
6. Save and run the program to see the output.

### Submission:
- Upload the code to GitHub and submit the GitHub link.

## Week 2: List Manipulation

### Instructions:
1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Append the following elements to `my_list`: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.
3. Insert the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. Extend `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element from `my_list`.
6. Sort `my_list` in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value `30` in `my_list`.

### Submission:
- Ensure your code is well-commented and organized before submitting.

## Week 3: Discount Calculation

### Instructions:
1. Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount.
   - The function should take the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.
   - If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
2. Using the `calculate_discount` function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

### Submission:
- Make sure your code is organized and includes comments explaining your logic.

## Week 4: File Read & Write Challenge

### Instructions:
1. Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
2. Implement error handling to ask the user for a filename and handle errors if the file doesnâ€™t exist or canâ€™t be read.

### Outcomes ðŸŽ‰
By the end of this module, youâ€™ll be skilled in managing files efficiently in Python, ensuring error-free code that gracefully handles unexpected issues. Mastering files and exception handling will allow you to build strong, robust applications!

### Submission:
- Ensure your code is well-structured and includes comments explaining your logic.
